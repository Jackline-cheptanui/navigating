        <p>The marriage between Abel and Patricia was fed like  the patriachial society <br>
          since men believed that women has no any voice at all to give opinion or make any suggestion.
          Patricia was an independent woman but Abel wanted to have control on her life<br>
          she was determined about her life even motivating her son by telling him that remember<br>
          that a man is not determined by how much he earn but it all about who you are.patricia<br>
          express to his son for him to know the value to women and the position to have.patriarchal<br>
          society is bad really because the worst moment to determiner that women has no voice<br>
          to support them self at all is when patricia went to the police station seeking<br>
         for assistance because Abel had beaten her but they assume by telling him that Abel is a caring man.
         Trevor noah realised ealy the problem,that Abel is spending profit  buying auto parts<br>
         on credit with a crazy markup and drinking instead of paying off debt,which just increased worse<br>
         Patricia badly quit her job for him to run the business,which start going better<br>
         but Abel begin drinking and keeping away the profit of the business.Eventually Patricia <br>
         gives up and get another secretary job,which get them the house in the highland north as<br>
          Abel creditor take away his workshops.
         Abel begins acting out on the standard gender rule of Tsonga culture based on a fundamental<br>
         belief that he owns his family and this gets to decide what he wants to do.He started demeaning her.
        Abel views the family as the property,he sees children as nothing more than extension of their father<br>
        he actually treats Andrew well because Andrew is his own son and effectively does not consider Trevoh noah<br>
         part of the family because he is not his son.
